                                When I first started using YNAB, I thought true budgeters kept their grocery bill really low. So, for a few months, I slashed our grocery budget, and it was... the worst. ðŸ˜‚ We would always go over, and I felt frustrated and defeated. Hereâ€™s what I eventually learned - I was under-budgeting. The numbers that worked for other people didnâ€™t work for us, and thatâ€™s ok. I spend more on groceries now, but Iâ€™m also trying to be smarter with that spending. One thing that has helped? Creating a groceries category group in my budget. Let me show you how! - Ashley
